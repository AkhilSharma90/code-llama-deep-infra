# A Playground for ðŸ¦™ `CodeLlama` in Streamlit via DeepInfra! 



## Overview
I've created a simple ðŸŽˆ[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app using [DeepInfra's inference API](https://deepinfra.com/docs/advanced/openai_api) to showcase the CodeLlama model that [Meta launched last Thursday](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/code-llama-ai-for-coding/).



## App Usage
The app is currently utilizing my DeepInfra key. This allows for free interactions producing responses up to 500 tokens. For more extended answers, users must input their own DeepInfra API key. If you need one, you can obtain it [here](https://deepinfra.com/dash/api_keys).

**Note**: [All Llama models are charged $1 per 1M tokens on DeepInfra](https://deepinfra.com/pricing)
